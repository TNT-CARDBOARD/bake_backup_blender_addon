# bake_backup_blender_addon

This addon has saved me hundreds of times. All it does is save all your textures to a folder before baking, without doing anything else. It doesn't have auto-delete or anything like that. You'll have to clear the history yourself. Otherwise, the folder can sometimes take up to 50 gigabytes if all your projects are in one folder for about a year.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: There aren't any, just download the file and add it as an addon in Edit - Preferences - Addons - Add New Addon
